Overview:
This analysis applies Multiple Linear Regression to a car dataset to predict fuel efficiency, specifically the city miles per gallon (mpg). The dataset includes various car features such as horsepower, torque, and width. After preprocessing the data, which involves handling missing values and ensuring correct data types, the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

A linear regression model is trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the test set. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). Additionally, a scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between the actual and predicted values, with a diagonal line representing perfect predictions. This analysis provides insights into how well the selected car features can predict fuel efficiency and highlights areas for potential model improvement.
